### Upload Options
1. **Export & Upload** (Recommended)
   - Includes all Capture One edits (color grading, adjustments, crops)
   - Auto-creates "Picflow Upload" recipe
   - JPEG format, web-ready
   - Automatic cleanup after upload

2. **Upload Original Files**
   - Direct RAW file upload
   - No export needed
   - For backup workflows

### Documentation
- ðŸ“– [**CAPTURE_ONE_INTEGRATION.md**](CAPTURE_ONE_INTEGRATION.md) - Complete integration guide
- ðŸ“š [**CAPTURE_ONE_API_REFERENCE.md**](CAPTURE_ONE_API_REFERENCE.md) - Full AppleScript API documentation

### Technical Notes
- Requires app sandbox to be disabled (direct distribution only, no Mac App Store)
- Uses `osascript` subprocess for reliable AppleScript execution
- Exports to isolated temp folder: `~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/CaptureOneExports/`
- **Recipe Configuration**: Use `root folder type` and `root folder location` properties (NOT `output location`)

**Planned Workflow:**
1. User selects images in Capture One
2. Picflow monitors selection and displays count
3. User triggers upload in Picflow
4. AppleScript exports via "Picflow Upload" recipe to temp folder
5. Picflow auto-uploads exported files
6. Temp files cleaned up automatically

**Example AppleScript:**
```applescript
-- Create/configure export recipe
tell application "Capture One"
    tell document 1
        set newRecipe to make new recipe with properties {name:"Picflow Upload"}
        tell newRecipe
            set root folder type to custom location
            set root folder location to "/path/to/export/folder"
        end tell
        set format of newRecipe to JPEG
        set quality of newRecipe to 90
        
        -- Process selected variants
        set selectedVariants to (get variants whose selected is true)
        repeat with v in selectedVariants
            process v recipe "Picflow Upload"
        end repeat
    end tell
end tell
```

## Developer Settings

Developer settings (API environment switcher, test features) are automatically hidden in production releases.

**Xcode builds:** Developer settings always visible (no setup needed)

**Production builds:** Enable with terminal command:
```bash
defaults write com.picflow.macos com.picflow.macos.developerMode -bool true
```
Then restart the app. To disable, set to `false`.
