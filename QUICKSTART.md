# 🚀 Quick Start: Test Your Changes

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Testing Authentication** - Faster development workflow  
✅ **Sentry Error Reporting** - Production-ready error tracking (commented, ready to activate)

---

## Try It Now (No Setup Required!)

### 1. Build and Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open Picflow/Picflow.xcodeproj

# Or via command line
xcodebuild -project Picflow/Picflow.xcodeproj -scheme Picflow build
```

### 2. Test the New Login Flow

When you launch the app:

1. **Look for the new login UI** with three options:
   - 🟦 "Login with Clerk" (OAuth - production)
   - 🟧 "Use Test Token" (NEW! - instant auth for testing)
   - ⚪ Custom token field (advanced testing)

2. **Click "Use Test Token"**
   - ⚡ Instant authentication (no OAuth flow)
   - 🏷️ "Test Mode" badge appears
   - ✅ Can immediately test uploads

3. **Verify it works**
   - Select a gallery
   - Upload a test image
   - Should work exactly like OAuth login

---

## Next: Enable Sentry (Optional, 10 min)

Sentry code is ready but commented out. When you're ready:

📖 Follow [SENTRY_SETUP_GUIDE.md](SENTRY_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Quick version:**
1. Create Sentry account → Get DSN
2. Add Sentry via SPM in Xcode: `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa`
3. Update `Constants.swift` with your DSN
4. Search for `// TODO: Uncomment` and uncomment all Sentry code
5. Build & test!

│  ⚠️  Test Mode           │  ← Shows when using test token
│                         │
│  [Login with Clerk]     │  ← OAuth (production)
│  ──────────────────     │
│  Development Testing    │

## Testing Checklist

### Test Token Authentication
- [ ] Launch app
- [ ] See new UI with three auth options
- [ ] Click "Use Test Token"
- [ ] "Test Mode" badge appears
- [ ] Successfully authenticated
- [ ] Can select gallery
- [ ] Can upload file
- [ ] OAuth still works (try "Login with Clerk")

### Verify No Regressions
- [ ] Existing OAuth flow still works
- [ ] Uploads work as before
- [ ] Folder monitoring works
- [ ] Capture One integration works
- [ ] No new console errors

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Use Test Token" doesn't work
- Check `Constants.hardcodedToken` is valid JWT
- Check token hasn't expired
- Check `Constants.tenantId` is correct

### Build errors
- Should not happen (all Sentry code is commented)
- If you see Sentry errors, check you didn't uncomment anything
- Clean build: Product → Clean Build Folder

### UI looks different
- That's expected! New UI is intentional
- Drag window to see full layout
- Test Mode badge only shows when using test token

---

## What's Next?

### Immediate (Ready Now)
✅ Test the new login flow  
✅ Use test token for faster development  
✅ Share feedback on the UI  

### Soon (When Ready)
⏳ Set up Sentry (10 min)  
⏳ Test error reporting in dev environment  
⏳ Deploy and monitor errors in production  

### Future (Documented in TBD)
📋 Multipart uploads for large files (>20MB)  
📋 Performance monitoring with Sentry  
📋 User identification for error tracking
