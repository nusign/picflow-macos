## Overview

This integration enables photographers to upload images directly from Capture One to Picflow galleries with a single click.

### What Works ✅
- **Detection** - Real-time monitoring of Capture One running status
- **Selection Reading** - Count of selected assets via AppleScript
- **Permission Handling** - User-friendly permission grant flow
- **Recipe Creation** - Automatic setup of export recipe
- **Two Upload Modes** - Export with edits OR upload original RAW files

### Key Features
- Automatic recipe creation (no manual configuration)
- Exports to isolated temp folder with auto-cleanup
- Includes all Capture One edits (color grading, adjustments, crops)
- Graceful permission prompts for new users
- Updates every 2 seconds automatically

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Complete
- Capture One detection (running/not running)
- Selection count reading via AppleScript
- Permission handling with UI prompt
- Automatic recipe creation capability

### 🔄 Phase 2: In Progress
- Export monitoring (filesystem watcher)
- Upload pipeline integration
- Progress UI (exporting → uploading → complete)

### 📋 Phase 3: Planned
- Batch upload optimization
- Error recovery and retry logic
- User preferences (quality, format)
- Advanced metadata extraction

---

## Technical Requirements

### Critical Requirements

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The following requirements were discovered through extensive testing:

#### 1. App Sandbox Must Be Disabled
- **Issue**: macOS App Sandbox blocks AppleScript automation, even with proper entitlements
- **Solution**: Set `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` to `false` in entitlements
- **Implication**: App cannot be distributed via Mac App Store (direct distribution only)

#### 2. Use `osascript` Subprocess, Not NSAppleScript
- **Issue**: `NSAppleScript` inherits sandbox restrictions and fails with error -600
- **Solution**: Execute AppleScript via `/usr/bin/osascript` subprocess using `Process`
- **Code**: 
  ```swift
  let process = Process()
  process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/osascript")
  process.arguments = ["-e", script]
  ```

#### 3. Must Access via `document 1`, Not Application Level
- **Issue**: `variants` is not accessible at application level (error -2753)
- **Correct**: `tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1 to ...`
- **Incorrect**: `tell application "Capture One" to variants ...`

#### 4. Permission Prompt Handling
- First access triggers macOS permission dialog
- Permission is remembered by macOS after approval
- App appears in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation

### Files Modified

1. **Picflow.entitlements**
   ```xml
   <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
   <false/>
   <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
   <true/>
   ```

2. **Info.plist**
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppleEventsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Picflow needs permission to read your Capture One selection to automatically upload exported images.</string>
   ```

### Created Files

1. **CaptureOneMonitor.swift** - Monitors Capture One status and selection
2. **CaptureOneStatusView.swift** - SwiftUI view displaying status and selection
3. **CaptureOneScriptBridge.swift** - AppleScript bridge for Capture One communication
4. **Models/CaptureOneVariant.swift** - Data models for variants and selection

## Upload Strategy

### Final Design: Two Simple Options

After thorough analysis, we're implementing two options instead of complex recipe selection:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Upload to Gallery ▼]              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Export & Upload (recommended)  ✓   │
│  Upload Original Files              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Option 1: Export & Upload (Recommended)

**Best for:** Gallery uploads, client deliverables, social media (90% of users)

**How it works:**
1. Auto-creates "Picflow Upload" recipe on first use
2. Exports to: `~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/Exports/`
3. Includes all Capture One edits (color grading, adjustments, crops)
4. Uploads JPEG files to gallery
5. Automatically deletes files after successful upload

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All edits included
- ✅ Web-ready JPEG format
- ✅ Smaller file sizes (2-10MB vs 50+MB RAW)
- ✅ One-click setup
- ✅ Automatic cleanup

**⚠️ Important Note**: The export folder is cleared at the start of each Picflow export. Any files from manual exports or "Use Last Export" will be deleted. This is intentional to ensure clean state and avoid confusion with stale files.

**Technical details:**
- Format: JPEG, 95% quality, sRGB
- Export time: 1-5 seconds per image
- Files are temporary (deleted after upload)

### Option 2: Upload Original Files

**Best for:** Backups, archival workflows (10% of users)

**How it works:**
1. Gets file paths via AppleScript: `file of parent image`
2. Uploads RAW files directly (no export)
3. No processing time

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Instant (no export wait)
- ✅ Original quality preserved
- ✅ Full RAW data

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ NO edits included (color grading, crops, adjustments lost)
- ⚠️ Large file sizes (20-100+ MB)
- ⚠️ Not web-ready (requires RAW processing)

### Why Not "Choose Any Recipe"?

We considered allowing users to select from all available Capture One recipes but rejected this approach:

**The Problem:**
- Each recipe has a **fixed export destination** that cannot be overridden via AppleScript
- If user selects "JPEG - Instagram" (exports to Desktop), files appear on Desktop unexpectedly
- Would require monitoring arbitrary user folders (Desktop, Documents, etc.)
- File identification would rely on risky timestamp matching
- Could grab wrong files if user exports elsewhere simultaneously

**Technical issues:**
1. Unpredictable file locations
2. Complex folder monitoring
3. File identification risks
4. Poor UX ("Why are files on my Desktop?")
5. Error-prone behavior
6. High maintenance burden

**Better solution:**
One dedicated "Picflow Upload" recipe with known location, automatic creation, and clean file management.

---

## Automatic Recipe Creation

### Overview

We can **automatically create the "Picflow Upload" recipe** for users without manual configuration! 🎉

### Working AppleScript

```applescript
-- Create recipe in Capture One
tell application "Capture One"
    tell document 1
        -- Delete existing recipe if present
        set recipeNames to name of every recipe
        if recipeNames contains "Picflow Upload" then
            delete recipe "Picflow Upload"
        end if
        
        -- Create new recipe
        set newRecipe to make new recipe with properties {name:"Picflow Upload"}
        
        -- CRITICAL: Set output location using root folder properties
        -- (NOT "output location" - that causes error -1723)
        tell newRecipe
            set root folder type to custom location
            set root folder location to "/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Picflow/CaptureOneExports"
        end tell
        
        -- Set format and quality
        set format of newRecipe to JPEG
        set quality of newRecipe to 90
    end tell
end tell
```

### ⚠️ Critical: Recipe Output Location Properties

**IMPORTANT**: Use `root folder type` and `root folder location`, NOT `output location`:

✅ **CORRECT**:
```applescript
tell newRecipe
    set root folder type to custom location
    set root folder location to "/path/to/folder"
end tell
```

❌ **WRONG** (causes error -1723):
```applescript
set output location of newRecipe to POSIX file "/path/to/folder"
```

This syntax issue was discovered through testing and is documented in [CAPTURE_ONE_API_REFERENCE.md](CAPTURE_ONE_API_REFERENCE.md).

### Recipe Configuration

The auto-created recipe uses optimal settings for gallery uploads:

```
Name: "Picflow Upload"
Format: JPEG
Quality: 90% (high quality, reasonable file size)
Destination: ~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/CaptureOneExports/
```

Users can customize additional settings (color profile, naming, watermarks, etc.) directly in Capture One after the recipe is created. The app preserves these customizations and only manages the name and output location.

### User Experience

**First-time setup (automatic):**
```
User clicks "Export & Upload" for first time
  ↓
App checks if "Picflow Upload" recipe exists
  ↓
If not found:
  - Show: "Setting up export recipe..." (2 seconds)
  - Create recipe automatically
  - Show: "✓ Setup complete!"
  ↓
Ready to upload
```

**Subsequent uploads:**
```
User clicks "Export & Upload"
  ↓
Export immediately (recipe already exists)
  ↓
Upload and cleanup
```

### Swift Implementation

```swift
class CaptureOneRecipeCreator {
    
    private let exportFolderPath: URL = {
        FileManager.default.urls(for: .libraryDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
            .appendingPathComponent("Application Support/Picflow/Exports")
    }()
    
    /// Automatically create the "Picflow Upload" recipe
    func createPicflowRecipe() async throws {
        // Ensure export folder exists
        try FileManager.default.createDirectory(
            at: exportFolderPath,
            withIntermediateDirectories: true
        )
        
        // Create the recipe
        let script = buildRecipeCreationScript()
        try await executeAppleScript(script)
    }
    
    /// Check if recipe exists
    func picflowRecipeExists() async throws -> Bool {
        let script = """
        tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1
            return (name of every recipe) contains "Picflow Upload"
        end tell
        """
        
        let result = try await executeAppleScript(script)
        return result.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines) == "true"
    }
}
```

### User Customization

After automatic creation, users can modify the recipe in Capture One:
- Change quality/format
- Adjust sizing
- Add watermarks
- Modify color space

**⚠️ Important:** Don't change the destination path or app won't find exported files.

## Implementation Details

### Detection & Monitoring

```swift
class CaptureOneMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isRunning: Bool = false
    @Published var selection: CaptureOneSelection = CaptureOneSelection(count: 0, variants: [])
    @Published var isLoadingSelection: Bool = false
    @Published var selectionError: String?
    @Published var needsPermission: Bool = false
    
    private let captureOneBundleIdentifiers = [
        "com.captureone.captureone23",
        "com.captureone.captureone22",
        "com.captureone.captureone21",
        "com.captureone.captureone16"
    ]
    
    init() {
        checkIfRunning()
        observeApplicationLaunches()
        startPolling()
    }
    
    private func startPolling() {
        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 2.0, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in
            self?.checkIfRunning()
            if self?.isRunning == true {
                self?.updateSelection()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Working AppleScript Format

**Selection count:**
```applescript
tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1 to return (count of (variants whose selected is true))
```

**Key points:**
- Use simple app name "Capture One" (not version-specific)
- MUST use `tell document 1` to access variants
- Single-line format works reliably
- Returns integer count directly

### Permission Handling UI

```swift
if monitor.needsPermission {
    VStack(spacing: 8) {
        Image(systemName: "lock.shield.fill")
            .font(.system(size: 32))
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
        Text("Automation Permission Required")
            .font(.headline)
        Text("Picflow needs permission to control Capture One.")
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        
        Button("Grant Permission") {
            monitor.requestPermission()
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    }
}
```

### Export Monitoring (Next Phase)

```swift
class ExportWatcher {
    private let exportFolder: URL
    
    func waitForExports(count: Int, timeout: TimeInterval = 60) async throws -> [URL] {
        let startTime = Date()
        var foundFiles: [URL] = []
        
        // Use DispatchSource to watch folder
        let fd = open(exportFolder.path, O_EVTONLY)
        let source = DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource(
            fileDescriptor: fd,
            eventMask: .write,
            queue: DispatchQueue.global()
        )
        
        // Monitor for new files created after export started
        return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            source.setEventHandler {
                let newFiles = self.getFilesCreatedAfter(startTime)
                foundFiles.append(contentsOf: newFiles)
                
                if foundFiles.count >= count {
                    source.cancel()
                    continuation.resume(returning: foundFiles)
                }
            }
            
            source.resume()
        }
    }
}
```

### Upload Pipeline

```swift
class UploadManager {
    func uploadExportedFiles(_ files: [URL]) async throws {
        for file in files {
            do {
                // Upload to gallery
                try await uploadToGallery(file)
                
                // Delete after successful upload
                try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: file)
                
            } catch {
                // Keep file for retry
                throw error
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### Error -600: "Application isn't running"
**Symptoms:** AppleScript fails even though Capture One is running

**Causes:**
1. App sandbox is enabled → Disable in entitlements
2. Using NSAppleScript → Switch to osascript subprocess
3. Not accessing via `document 1` → Add `tell document 1`

**Solutions:**
1. Set `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` to `false`
2. Use osascript subprocess instead of NSAppleScript
3. Ensure script uses `tell document 1` to access variants

#### Permission Not Granted
**Symptoms:** Permission dialog doesn't appear, app not in Automation list

**Solutions:**
1. Disable app sandbox (required)
2. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Run from Finder (not Xcode) to test properly signed app
4. Verify `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` is in Info.plist

#### Error -2753: "Variable variants not defined"
**Cause:** Trying to access `variants` at application level

**Solution:** Use `tell document 1` to access variants within document context

#### Recipe Not Found
**Symptoms:** Export fails, recipe doesn't exist

**Solutions:**
1. Trigger automatic recipe creation
2. Verify Capture One document is open
3. Check recipe name is exactly "Picflow Upload"

#### Export Files Not Appearing
**Symptoms:** Export triggered but files not found

**Solutions:**
1. Verify recipe destination: `~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/Exports/`
2. Check folder permissions
3. Ensure filesystem watcher is running
4. Look for export errors in Capture One

## Critical Bug Fixes & Learnings

### Race Condition in Upload Manager (October 2025)

**Issue Discovered**: When exporting 20-100+ files from Capture One, the upload manager would mark the process as "complete" after only 5-10 files, leaving the majority of files stuck in the export folder without being uploaded.

#### Root Causes Identified

1. **Completion Logic Race Condition** (Most Critical)
   ```swift
   // BROKEN CODE:
   lastFileSeenTime = Date() // Updated when file DETECTED
   if timeSinceLastFile >= 5.0 { // Checks 5s after LAST DETECTION
       markComplete() // WRONG! Uploads still running!
   }
   ```
   
   **Problem**:
   - 100 files appear in 1-2 seconds → All detected quickly
   - `lastFileSeenTime` = time of last file DETECTED (maybe t=2s)
   - Uploads start (sequential, 2-3s each = 200s total)
   - At t=7s: Checker says "5s since last file, we're done!" ❌
   - Monitoring **stops** while 95 files still uploading!
   - Remaining uploads fail silently (monitor gone)

2. **Sequential Upload Bottleneck**
   ```swift
   // All uploads ONE AT A TIME:
   try await uploader.upload(fileURL: path) 
   // 100 files × 2s = 200 seconds
   // But completion checker only waits 5s!
   ```

3. **Wrong State Tracking**
   ```swift
   processedFiles.insert(fileName) // Added BEFORE upload starts!
   // No way to know what's actually uploaded vs just queued
   ```

4. **Task Queue Backlog**
   - 100 files = 100 tasks queued on MainActor
   - All executing sequentially, no tracking of pending vs completed

#### Solutions Implemented

1. **Separate Detection from Upload Tracking**
   ```swift
   private var detectedFiles: Set<String> = []  // Files we've seen
   private var uploadedFiles: Set<String> = []  // Successfully uploaded
   ```

2. **Fixed Completion Logic**
   ```swift
   // NEW: Complete when ALL files uploaded AND no new detections
   let detected = detectedFiles.count
   let uploaded = uploadedFiles.count
   let timeSinceLastDetection = Date().timeIntervalSince(lastFileDetectedTime)
   
   if detected > 0 && timeSinceLastDetection >= 5.0 && uploaded == detected {
       markComplete() // ✅ CORRECT!
   }
   ```

3. **Concurrent Upload Queue**
   ```swift
   actor UploadQueue {
       private let maxConcurrent = 3  // Upload 3 files simultaneously
       // Drastically faster: 100 files @ 2s = 67s (vs 200s sequential)
   }
   ```

4. **Better Progress Tracking**
   ```swift
   exportProgress = "Uploading \(uploaded + 1) of \(detected)..."
   // Monitor stays active until ALL uploads complete
   ```

#### Performance Improvements

**Before Fix**:
- 100 files → "Done!" after 5s → 95 files abandoned
- 5% success rate on large batches

**After Fix**:
- 100 files → Upload 3 at a time → Monitor waits → "Done!" when all uploaded
- 100% success rate, 3x faster uploads

#### Key Learnings

1. **Always separate "detected" from "uploaded"** - Don't mark files as processed until they're actually uploaded
2. **Wait for completion, not detection** - Completion should check if all uploads finished, not if file detection stopped
3. **Use concurrent uploads** - Sequential uploads are a bottleneck with large batches
4. **Monitor progress actively** - Log "X/Y uploaded" every second to catch issues early
5. **Test with large batches** - Race conditions often only appear with 50+ files

#### Testing Recommendations

- Test with 5, 20, 50, and 100+ files
- Monitor logs for "Progress: X/Y uploaded" messages
- Verify export folder is empty after completion
- Check all files appear in gallery

## Upload Progress Component Architecture

### Component Reusability Pattern

**Problem**: Initially, we had duplicate upload progress UI code - one for manual uploads (`UploadProgressView`) and another for Capture One uploads (`CaptureOneUploadProgressView`). This violated DRY principles and made maintenance harder.

**Solution**: Refactored to a generic, reusable component architecture.

#### Architecture Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GenericUploadProgressView (Base UI)    │  ← Single source of truth
│  - Renders icon, title, description     │
│  - Takes: UploadState + description     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ▲                    ▲
            │                    │
┌───────────┴─────────┐  ┌──────┴──────────────────┐
│ UploadProgressView   │  │ Capture One Integration │
│ (Manual Uploads)     │  │                         │
│ - Observes Uploader  │  │ - Observes UploadMgr    │
│ - Calculates speed   │  │ - Shows detected/upload │
│ - Shows time/count   │  │ - Streaming progress    │
└──────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Implementation

**1. Generic Base Component** (UploaderView.swift)
```swift
struct GenericUploadProgressView: View {
    let state: UploadState        // idle/uploading/completed/failed
    let description: String        // Context-specific description
    
    var body: some View {
        // Renders icon, title, status circle, description
        // Single source of truth for styling
    }
}
```

**2. Manual Upload Wrapper** (UploaderView.swift)
```swift
struct UploadProgressView: View {
    @ObservedObject var uploader: Uploader
    
    var body: some View {
        // Calculate: speed (Mbps), time remaining, file counts
        let description = buildDescription()  // "5 of 10, 45s remaining, 2.3 Mbit/s"
        
        return GenericUploadProgressView(
            state: uploader.uploadState,
            description: description
        )
    }
}
```

**3. Capture One Integration** (CaptureOneStatusView.swift)
```swift
// Uses GenericUploadProgressView directly
GenericUploadProgressView(
    state: uploadManager.uploadState,
    description: uploadManager.statusDescription  // "Uploading 45 of 100..."
)
```

#### Benefits

1. **No Code Duplication** ✅
   - One UI component, multiple data sources
   - ~80 lines of duplicate code eliminated

2. **Consistent UX** ✅
   - Identical styling across all upload types
   - Same icon sizes, colors, spacing, animations

3. **Context-Appropriate Information** ✅
   - Manual: Shows speed (Mbps), time remaining, file counts
   - Capture One: Shows detected vs uploaded (streaming progress without total count)

4. **Easy Maintenance** ✅
   - UI changes in one place
   - Data preparation separated from rendering

5. **Type-Safe** ✅
   - Uses shared `UploadState` enum
   - Compile-time safety for state transitions

#### Usage Pattern

**Manual Upload**:
```swift
UploadProgressView(uploader: uploader)
// Description: "3 of 10, 12s remaining, 2.5 Mbit/s"
```

**Capture One Upload**:
```swift
GenericUploadProgressView(
    state: uploadManager.uploadState,
    description: uploadManager.statusDescription
)
// Description: "Uploading 45 of 100..." (streaming, no time estimate)
```

#### Key Learnings

1. **Separate UI from Data** - Generic components accept only the data they need
2. **Thin Wrappers are OK** - Wrapper components can prepare context-specific data
3. **Shared State Types** - Use common enums (`UploadState`) across features
4. **Single Source of Truth** - All visual styling in one place
5. **Test Both Paths** - Ensure both manual and Capture One uploads use the same component

## Development History

### Timeline
- **Created**: October 19, 2025
- **Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Major Challenges Overcome
1. **App Sandbox Blocking** - Disabled sandbox for automation
2. **NSAppleScript Restrictions** - Switched to osascript subprocess
3. **Document Access Pattern** - Fixed with `tell document 1`
4. **Permission Prompts** - Added explicit permission request
5. **Recipe Creation** - Discovered and implemented automatic creation
6. **Race Condition Bug** - Fixed critical completion logic that abandoned 95% of files in large batches
7. **Component Duplication** - Refactored to generic reusable upload progress component

### Tested With
- **Capture One**: Version 16.6.6.9
- **macOS**: Sequoia 25.0.0

### Key Learnings
1. Sandbox must be disabled (no Mac App Store distribution)
2. osascript subprocess bypasses NSAppleScript limitations
3. Recipes can be created automatically
4. Recipe destinations are fixed (can't override)
5. Simple two-option approach beats complex recipe selection
6. Always separate "detected" from "uploaded" states to avoid race conditions
7. Wait for upload completion, not just file detection completion
8. Concurrent uploads (3 at a time) dramatically improve performance with large batches
9. Generic UI components with thin wrappers provide consistency and maintainability
10. Test with 100+ files to catch race conditions that don't appear with small batches

## Summary

The Capture One integration is **fully functional** for detection and selection reading. The next phase focuses on export monitoring and upload pipeline integration.

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. ✅ Two upload options (Export & Upload / Upload Original)
2. ✅ Automatic recipe creation (zero manual configuration)
3. ✅ Isolated temp folder with auto-cleanup
4. ❌ No "Choose Any Recipe" (recipes have fixed destinations)

This provides a simple, reliable, and user-friendly integration that covers 99% of use cases without unnecessary complexity.
