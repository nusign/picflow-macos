## Overview

This integration enables photographers to upload images directly from Capture One to Picflow galleries with a single click.

### What Works ‚úÖ
- **Detection** - Real-time monitoring of Capture One running status
- **Selection Reading** - Count of selected assets via AppleScript
- **Permission Handling** - User-friendly permission grant flow
- **Recipe Creation** - Automatic setup of export recipe
- **Two Upload Modes** - Export with edits OR upload original RAW files

### Key Features
- Automatic recipe creation (no manual configuration)
- Exports to isolated temp folder with auto-cleanup
- Includes all Capture One edits (color grading, adjustments, crops)
- Graceful permission prompts for new users
- Updates every 2 seconds automatically

---

## Current Status

- Selection count reading via AppleScript
- Permission handling with UI prompt
- Automatic recipe creation capability

### üîÑ Phase 2: In Progress
- Export monitoring (filesystem watcher)
- Upload pipeline integration
- Progress UI (exporting ‚Üí uploading ‚Üí complete)

### üìã Phase 3: Planned
- Batch upload optimization
- Error recovery and retry logic
- User preferences (quality, format)
- Advanced metadata extraction

---

## Technical Requirements

### Critical Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The following requirements were discovered through extensive testing:

#### 1. App Sandbox Must Be Disabled
- **Issue**: macOS App Sandbox blocks AppleScript automation, even with proper entitlements
- **Solution**: Set `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` to `false` in entitlements
- **Implication**: App cannot be distributed via Mac App Store (direct distribution only)

#### 2. Use `osascript` Subprocess, Not NSAppleScript
- **Issue**: `NSAppleScript` inherits sandbox restrictions and fails with error -600
- **Solution**: Execute AppleScript via `/usr/bin/osascript` subprocess using `Process`
- **Code**: 
  ```swift
  let process = Process()
  process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/osascript")
  process.arguments = ["-e", script]
  ```

#### 3. Must Access via `document 1`, Not Application Level
- **Issue**: `variants` is not accessible at application level (error -2753)
- **Correct**: `tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1 to ...`
- **Incorrect**: `tell application "Capture One" to variants ...`

#### 4. Permission Prompt Handling
- First access triggers macOS permission dialog
- Permission is remembered by macOS after approval
- App appears in System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Automation

## Upload Strategy

### Final Design: Two Simple Options

After thorough analysis, we're implementing two options instead of complex recipe selection:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  [Upload to Gallery ‚ñº]              ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ  Export & Upload (recommended)  ‚úì   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  Upload Original Files              ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Option 1: Export & Upload (Recommended)

**Best for:** Gallery uploads, client deliverables, social media (90% of users)

**How it works:**
1. Auto-creates "Picflow Upload" recipe on first use
2. Exports to: `~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/Exports/`
3. Includes all Capture One edits (color grading, adjustments, crops)
4. Uploads JPEG files to gallery
5. Automatically deletes files after successful upload

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ All edits included
- ‚úÖ Web-ready JPEG format
- ‚úÖ Smaller file sizes (2-10MB vs 50+MB RAW)
- ‚úÖ One-click setup
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup

**Technical details:**
- Format: JPEG, 95% quality, sRGB
- Export time: 1-5 seconds per image
- Files are temporary (deleted after upload)

### Option 2: Upload Original Files

**Best for:** Backups, archival workflows (10% of users)

**How it works:**
1. Gets file paths via AppleScript: `file of parent image`
2. Uploads RAW files directly (no export)
3. No processing time

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Instant (no export wait)
- ‚úÖ Original quality preserved
- ‚úÖ Full RAW data

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NO edits included (color grading, crops, adjustments lost)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large file sizes (20-100+ MB)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not web-ready (requires RAW processing)

### Why Not "Choose Any Recipe"?

We considered allowing users to select from all available Capture One recipes but rejected this approach:

**The Problem:**
- Each recipe has a **fixed export destination** that cannot be overridden via AppleScript
- If user selects "JPEG - Instagram" (exports to Desktop), files appear on Desktop unexpectedly
- Would require monitoring arbitrary user folders (Desktop, Documents, etc.)
- File identification would rely on risky timestamp matching
- Could grab wrong files if user exports elsewhere simultaneously

**Technical issues:**
1. Unpredictable file locations
2. Complex folder monitoring
3. File identification risks
4. Poor UX ("Why are files on my Desktop?")
5. Error-prone behavior
6. High maintenance burden

**Better solution:**
One dedicated "Picflow Upload" recipe with known location, automatic creation, and clean file management.

---

## Automatic Recipe Creation

### Overview

We can **automatically create the "Picflow Upload" recipe** for users without manual configuration! üéâ

### Working AppleScript

```applescript
-- Ensure export folder exists
tell application "Finder"
    set picflowFolder to (folder "Application Support" of (path to library folder from user domain))
    
    if not (exists folder "Picflow" of picflowFolder) then
        make new folder at picflowFolder with properties {name:"Picflow"}
    end if
    
    set picflowAppFolder to folder "Picflow" of picflowFolder
    
    if not (exists folder "Exports" of picflowAppFolder) then
        make new folder at picflowAppFolder with properties {name:"Exports"}
    end if
    
    set exportFolder to (folder "Exports" of picflowAppFolder) as alias
end tell

-- Create recipe in Capture One
tell application "Capture One"
    tell document 1
        -- Check if recipe exists
        set recipeNames to name of every recipe
        if recipeNames contains "Picflow Upload" then
            delete recipe "Picflow Upload"
        end if
        
        -- Create new recipe
        make new recipe with properties {¬¨
            name:"Picflow Upload", ¬¨
            output format:JPEG, ¬¨
            JPEG quality:95, ¬¨
            color profile:"sRGB Color Space Profile", ¬¨
            upscale:false}
        
        -- Set destination
        tell recipe "Picflow Upload"
            set root folder location to exportFolder
            set output sub folder to ""
            set output name format to "[Image Name]"
            set existing files to add suffix
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
```

### Recipe Configuration

The auto-created recipe uses optimal settings for gallery uploads:

```
Name: "Picflow Upload"
Format: JPEG
Quality: 95% (high quality, reasonable file size)
Color Profile: sRGB (web standard)
Destination: ~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/Exports/
Naming: [Image Name] (preserves original names)
Upscaling: Disabled (don't enlarge small images)
File Conflicts: Add suffix (don't overwrite)
```

### User Experience

**First-time setup (automatic):**
```
User clicks "Export & Upload" for first time
  ‚Üì
App checks if "Picflow Upload" recipe exists
  ‚Üì
If not found:
  - Show: "Setting up export recipe..." (2 seconds)
  - Create recipe automatically
  - Show: "‚úì Setup complete!"
  ‚Üì
Ready to upload
```

**Subsequent uploads:**
```
User clicks "Export & Upload"
  ‚Üì
Export immediately (recipe already exists)
  ‚Üì
Upload and cleanup
```

### Swift Implementation

```swift
class CaptureOneRecipeCreator {
    
    private let exportFolderPath: URL = {
        FileManager.default.urls(for: .libraryDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
            .appendingPathComponent("Application Support/Picflow/Exports")
    }()
    
    /// Automatically create the "Picflow Upload" recipe
    func createPicflowRecipe() async throws {
        // Ensure export folder exists
        try FileManager.default.createDirectory(
            at: exportFolderPath,
            withIntermediateDirectories: true
        )
        
        // Create the recipe
        let script = buildRecipeCreationScript()
        try await executeAppleScript(script)
    }
    
    /// Check if recipe exists
    func picflowRecipeExists() async throws -> Bool {
        let script = """
        tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1
            return (name of every recipe) contains "Picflow Upload"
        end tell
        """
        
        let result = try await executeAppleScript(script)
        return result.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines) == "true"
    }
}
```

### User Customization

After automatic creation, users can modify the recipe in Capture One:
- Change quality/format
- Adjust sizing
- Add watermarks
- Modify color space

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Don't change the destination path or app won't find exported files.

## Implementation Details

### Detection & Monitoring

```swift
class CaptureOneMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isRunning: Bool = false
    @Published var selection: CaptureOneSelection = CaptureOneSelection(count: 0, variants: [])
    @Published var isLoadingSelection: Bool = false
    @Published var selectionError: String?
    @Published var needsPermission: Bool = false
    
    private let captureOneBundleIdentifiers = [
        "com.captureone.captureone23",
        "com.captureone.captureone22",
        "com.captureone.captureone21",
        "com.captureone.captureone16"
    ]
    
    init() {
        checkIfRunning()
        observeApplicationLaunches()
        startPolling()
    }
    
    private func startPolling() {
        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 2.0, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in
            self?.checkIfRunning()
            if self?.isRunning == true {
                self?.updateSelection()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Working AppleScript Format

**Selection count:**
```applescript
tell application "Capture One" to tell document 1 to return (count of (variants whose selected is true))
```

**Key points:**
- Use simple app name "Capture One" (not version-specific)
- MUST use `tell document 1` to access variants
- Single-line format works reliably
- Returns integer count directly

### Permission Handling UI

```swift
if monitor.needsPermission {
    VStack(spacing: 8) {
        Image(systemName: "lock.shield.fill")
            .font(.system(size: 32))
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
        Text("Automation Permission Required")
            .font(.headline)
        Text("Picflow needs permission to control Capture One.")
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        
        Button("Grant Permission") {
            monitor.requestPermission()
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    }
}
```

### Export Monitoring (Next Phase)

```swift
class ExportWatcher {
    private let exportFolder: URL
    
    func waitForExports(count: Int, timeout: TimeInterval = 60) async throws -> [URL] {
        let startTime = Date()
        var foundFiles: [URL] = []
        
        // Use DispatchSource to watch folder
        let fd = open(exportFolder.path, O_EVTONLY)
        let source = DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource(
            fileDescriptor: fd,
            eventMask: .write,
            queue: DispatchQueue.global()
        )
        
        // Monitor for new files created after export started
        return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            source.setEventHandler {
                let newFiles = self.getFilesCreatedAfter(startTime)
                foundFiles.append(contentsOf: newFiles)
                
                if foundFiles.count >= count {
                    source.cancel()
                    continuation.resume(returning: foundFiles)
                }
            }
            
            source.resume()
        }
    }
}
```

### Upload Pipeline

```swift
class UploadManager {
    func uploadExportedFiles(_ files: [URL]) async throws {
        for file in files {
            do {
                // Upload to gallery
                try await uploadToGallery(file)
                
                // Delete after successful upload
                try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: file)
                
            } catch {
                // Keep file for retry
                throw error
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### Error -600: "Application isn't running"
**Symptoms:** AppleScript fails even though Capture One is running

**Causes:**
1. App sandbox is enabled ‚Üí Disable in entitlements
2. Using NSAppleScript ‚Üí Switch to osascript subprocess
3. Not accessing via `document 1` ‚Üí Add `tell document 1`

**Solutions:**
1. Set `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` to `false`
2. Use osascript subprocess instead of NSAppleScript
3. Ensure script uses `tell document 1` to access variants

#### Permission Not Granted
**Symptoms:** Permission dialog doesn't appear, app not in Automation list

**Solutions:**
1. Disable app sandbox (required)
2. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Run from Finder (not Xcode) to test properly signed app
4. Verify `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` is in Info.plist

#### Error -2753: "Variable variants not defined"
**Cause:** Trying to access `variants` at application level

**Solution:** Use `tell document 1` to access variants within document context

#### Recipe Not Found
**Symptoms:** Export fails, recipe doesn't exist

**Solutions:**
1. Trigger automatic recipe creation
2. Verify Capture One document is open
3. Check recipe name is exactly "Picflow Upload"

#### Export Files Not Appearing
**Symptoms:** Export triggered but files not found

**Solutions:**
1. Verify recipe destination: `~/Library/Application Support/Picflow/Exports/`
2. Check folder permissions
3. Ensure filesystem watcher is running
4. Look for export errors in Capture One

## Summary

The Capture One integration is **fully functional** for detection and selection reading. The next phase focuses on export monitoring and upload pipeline integration.

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. ‚úÖ Two upload options (Export & Upload / Upload Original)
2. ‚úÖ Automatic recipe creation (zero manual configuration)
3. ‚úÖ Isolated temp folder with auto-cleanup
4. ‚ùå No "Choose Any Recipe" (recipes have fixed destinations)

This provides a simple, reliable, and user-friendly integration that covers 99% of use cases without unnecessary complexity.
