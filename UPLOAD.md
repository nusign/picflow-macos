# Smart Concurrent Upload Implementation

## Overview

The uploader uses **smart coordination** to handle concurrent uploads efficiently while preventing resource contention from multiple large file uploads.

## Upload Strategy

### Small Files (Single-Part Upload)
- ‚úÖ Upload **concurrently** (up to 3 at once)
- ‚úÖ Fast and efficient for multiple small files
- ‚úÖ Each file is a single operation

### Large Files (Multipart Upload)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only **ONE multipart upload at a time**
- ‚úÖ Within that file, **5 chunks upload concurrently**
- ‚úÖ Prevents overwhelming API with multiple multipart requests
- ‚úÖ Avoids multiple file readers and excessive memory usage

## Configuration

```swift
struct UploadConcurrencyConfig {
    // Maximum number of concurrent small file uploads
    static let maxConcurrentSmallFiles = 3
    
    // Maximum number of concurrent chunks within a large file
    static let maxConcurrentChunks = 5
}
```

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Multiple Small Files
```
Queue: 5 small files (10 MB each)

Execution:
File1, File2, File3 ‚Üí Upload concurrently
  ‚Üì (File1 completes)
File4 starts uploading
  ‚Üì (File2 completes)
File5 starts uploading
  ‚Üì All complete

Result: 3 files uploading at any time, fast completion
```

### Scenario 2: One Large File
```
Queue: 1 large file (150 MB, 15 chunks)

Execution:
File1 acquires multipart lock
  ‚Üí Chunk1, Chunk2, Chunk3, Chunk4, Chunk5 upload concurrently
    ‚Üì (Chunk1 completes)
  ‚Üí Chunk6 starts
    ...continues until all chunks complete
File1 releases multipart lock

Result: 5 chunks uploading at any time, optimal throughput
```

### Scenario 3: Mixed Files (THE KEY SCENARIO)
```
Queue: 
- 3 small files (10 MB each)
- 1 large file (150 MB, 15 chunks)
- 2 small files (10 MB each)

Execution:
Small1, Small2, Small3 ‚Üí Upload concurrently
  ‚Üì (all complete)
Large1 ‚Üí Acquires multipart lock
  ‚Üí Uploads 5 chunks at a time concurrently
  ‚Üí Releases lock when done
Small4, Small5 ‚Üí Upload concurrently
  ‚Üì All complete

Result: Small files don't wait unnecessarily, large file gets full resources
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Large Files
```
Queue: 3 large files (100 MB each, 10 chunks)

Execution:
Large1 ‚Üí Acquires multipart lock
  ‚Üí Uploads all 10 chunks (5 concurrent)
  ‚Üí Releases lock
Large2 ‚Üí Acquires multipart lock (was waiting)
  ‚Üí Uploads all 10 chunks (5 concurrent)
  ‚Üí Releases lock
Large3 ‚Üí Acquires multipart lock (was waiting)
  ‚Üí Uploads all 10 chunks (5 concurrent)
  ‚Üí Releases lock

Result: Sequential multipart uploads, no API overload
```

## Architecture

### 1. ConcurrencyCoordinator (Actor)
**File**: `Picflow/Services/ConcurrencyCoordinator.swift`

```swift
actor ConcurrencyCoordinator {
    // Chunk-level concurrency (within a file)
    private var activeOperations: Int = 0
    private let maxConcurrent: Int
    
    // Multipart exclusivity
    private var isMultipartUploadActive: Bool = false
    private var waitingForMultipart: [CheckedContinuation<Void, Never>] = []
    
    func acquireSlot() async        // For chunk uploads
    func releaseSlot()              // Release chunk slot
    
    func acquireMultipartLock() async  // Get exclusive multipart access
    func releaseMultipartLock()        // Release multipart access
    func isMultipartActive() -> Bool   // Check if multipart is running
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Chunk Slots**: Manage concurrent chunks within a multipart upload
- **Multipart Lock**: Ensure only one multipart upload at a time
- **FIFO Queue**: Waiting multipart uploads processed in order
- **Thread-safe**: Actor model ensures safety

### 2. Smart Upload Queue Processing
**File**: `Picflow/Services/Uploader.swift`

The `processQueue()` method intelligently handles the queue:

```swift
// Check if file needs multipart
let isMultipart = MultiPartUploadConfig.shouldUseMultipart(fileSize: fileSize)

// For multipart: Check if another multipart is active
if isMultipart {
    let canStart = await concurrencyCoordinator.isMultipartActive() == false
    if !canStart {
        break  // Wait for current multipart to complete
    }
}

// For small files: Check concurrent limit
if !isMultipart && filesInProgress >= maxConcurrentSmallFiles {
    break  // At concurrent limit
}
```

### 3. Multipart Upload with Lock
**File**: `Picflow/Services/Uploader.swift`

```swift
private func uploadMultiPart(...) async throws {
    // Acquire exclusive lock
    await concurrencyCoordinator.acquireMultipartLock()
    
    defer {
        // Always release lock when done (even on error)
        Task {
            await concurrencyCoordinator.releaseMultipartLock()
        }
    }
    
    // Upload chunks concurrently (up to 5 at once)
    for chunk in chunks {
        await concurrencyCoordinator.acquireSlot()  // Get chunk slot
        uploadChunk(...)
        await concurrencyCoordinator.releaseSlot()  // Release slot
    }
}
```

## Benefits

### Performance
- ‚úÖ **Small files upload quickly**: Multiple files don't wait
- ‚úÖ **Large files get full bandwidth**: All 5 chunk slots available
- ‚úÖ **No API overload**: Only one multipart create/complete at a time

### Resource Management
- ‚úÖ **One file reader at a time** for large files
- ‚úÖ **Fewer concurrent API requests** (3 small + 1 multipart max)
- ‚úÖ **Memory efficient**: Chunks streamed, not held in memory

### Reliability
- ‚úÖ **Error isolation**: Failed files don't block others
- ‚úÖ **Automatic retry**: Chunks retry with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ **Lock always released**: `defer` ensures cleanup

## Progress Tracking

### How It Works
- Each file tracks its own progress (0.0 to 1.0)
- Overall progress weighted by file sizes
- Real-time updates as chunks complete
- Works correctly with concurrent uploads

```swift
// Per-file progress tracking
private var fileProgress: [URL: Double] = [:]
private var fileSizes: [URL: Int64] = [:]

// Calculate weighted overall progress
func updateOverallProgress() {
    var totalWeighted = 0.0
    for (fileURL, progress) in fileProgress {
        let weight = Double(fileSizes[fileURL]!) / Double(totalBytesInQueue)
        totalWeighted += weight * progress
    }
    uploadProgress = totalWeighted
}
```

## Why This Approach?

### Problem with Concurrent Multipart Uploads
```
‚ùå BAD: 3 large files starting simultaneously
- 3 "Create Asset" API calls
- 30 presigned URLs requested
- 3 file readers open
- 30 chunk tasks created
- But only 5 chunks actually uploading!
- Wasted resources, API pressure
```

### Solution: Smart Coordination
```
‚úÖ GOOD: Sequential multipart, concurrent small files
- 1 "Create Asset" API call at a time for large files
- 1 file reader open for large file
- 10 chunk tasks for current file
- 5 chunks uploading concurrently
- Small files upload alongside when available
- Clean resource usage, optimal performance
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Multipart Upload Fails
- Lock is released in `defer` block
- Next multipart can proceed immediately
- Small files unaffected

### 2. Queue Has Only Small Files
- All upload concurrently (up to limit)
- No multipart coordination needed
- Fast completion

### 3. Queue Has Only Large Files
- Process sequentially
- Each gets full chunk concurrency
- Prevents API overload

### 4. Mixed Queue Order Matters
- Small files at start ‚Üí Upload concurrently first
- Large file ‚Üí Waits for small files, then gets exclusive access
- Small files after ‚Üí Wait for large file, then upload concurrently

## Configuration Tips

### Tuning `maxConcurrentSmallFiles`
- **Low (1-2)**: Conservative, sequential-like
- **Medium (3)**: Balanced (default)
- **High (5+)**: Aggressive, more API calls

**Recommendation**: 3 for most cases

### Tuning `maxConcurrentChunks`
- **Low (2-3)**: Conservative bandwidth
- **Medium (5)**: Balanced (default)
- **High (8-10)**: Aggressive, faster large files

**Recommendation**: 5 for good balance

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: 10 Small Files
```swift
// Expected: 3 uploading at once, rolling window
// Verify: Fast completion, no blocking
```

### Test 2: 1 Large File (100 MB)
```swift
// Expected: 5 chunks concurrent
// Verify: Single multipart lock, optimal speed
```

### Test 3: Mixed (3 Small + 1 Large + 2 Small)
```swift
// Expected: Small files first (3 concurrent)
//          Large file next (exclusive, 5 chunks)
//          Small files last (2 concurrent)
// Verify: No blocking, smooth progression
```

### Test 4: 3 Large Files
```swift
// Expected: Sequential multipart uploads
// Verify: Only one multipart active at a time
//         Each gets full 5-chunk concurrency
```

## Monitoring

### Logging
```swift
// Queue start
print("üöÄ UPLOAD QUEUE: \(count) files (smart coordination)")

// Multipart start
print("   Uploading in \(partCount) parts (\(chunkSize) each)")

// Progress
print("   Progress: \(completed)/\(total) parts (\(percent)%)")

// Completion
print("‚úÖ QUEUE COMPLETE: All \(count) files processed")
```
